ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @mreldred08 or Mike :)
Iâ€™m interested in front-end development. Brand new to this, and taking Colt Steele's Web Development bootcamp. 
Iâ€™m currently learning HTML/CSS/Javascript.
Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on literally anything related to HTML/CSS/Javascript, and looking for a remote entry-level job related to front-end development. 
I have been working on freecodecamp.com as well. I have a Bachelors of Science, but am looking for a career change.
